# Luminara Release Notes

## Version 0.3.0 (October 30, 2025)

### ðŸš€ Major Improvements

#### Driver Architecture Restructure
- **Conceptual Separation**: Refactored `src/drivers/` folder into separate directories for better organization
  - `src/drivers/native/` - Native fetch driver with modular utilities
  - `src/drivers/ofetch/` - Ofetch driver implementation
  - Each driver now has its own dedicated directory and utilities

#### Test Infrastructure Overhaul
- **Port Migration**: Updated all CLI test mock servers from 3XXX to 42XX port pattern
  - Prevents conflicts with common development services (webpack, Vite, etc.)
  - Each test suite now has dedicated port for parallel execution
  - Port allocation: 4201 (default), 4202 (backoff), 4203 (plugins), 4204 (retry), 4205 (timeout), 4206 (drivers), 4207 (react-sim), 4209 (enhanced-interceptors), 4211 (basic)

- **Timing Tolerance Improvements**: Enhanced test reliability with generous timing tolerances
  - Â±300-500ms tolerances for network-dependent tests
  - Â±500-700ms tolerances for full test suite execution
  - Prevents flaky tests due to system load and network variance

- **React Test Structure Refactoring**: Organized React browser tests into modular architecture
  - `basicHttpTests.js` - Fundamental HTTP operations
  - `contentTypeTests.js` - Content type handling
  - `queryHeaderTests.js` - Query parameters and headers
  - `retryErrorTests.js` - Retry logic and error handling
  - `backoffTests.js` - Backoff strategies
  - `timeoutTests.js` - Timeout handling
  - `pluginTests.js` - Plugin system and interceptors
  - `driverTests.js` - Driver comparisons
  - Main `testDefinitions.js` aggregates all modules

#### Development Process Improvements
- **Enhanced Copilot Instructions**: Added comprehensive guidelines for:
  - Mock server port allocation (42XX pattern)
  - Timing tolerance requirements
  - React test environment manual validation
  - Efficient testing strategies (targeted vs comprehensive)

- **Folder Restructuring**: Renamed `test/` to `test-cli/` for better clarity
  - Aligns with `test-on-react-app/` naming convention
  - Makes CLI testing purpose explicit
  - Updated all references and documentation

### ðŸŽ¯ Performance & Reliability
- **100% Test Success Rate**: All 96 CLI tests passing consistently
- **22/22 React Browser Tests**: Perfect success rate in browser environment
- **Service Isolation**: Eliminated port conflicts with development tools
- **Maintainable Architecture**: Better separation of concerns across all test environments

### ðŸ”§ Technical Details
- **Driver Organization**: Clear conceptual separation between driver types
- **Test Port Range**: 42XX pattern prevents conflicts with common services
- **Modular Testing**: Each test category in separate, focused files
- **Documentation**: Updated copilot instructions with testing best practices

### ðŸ“Š Metrics
- **CLI Tests**: 96/96 passing (100% success rate)
- **React Tests**: 22/22 passing (100% success rate)
- **Test Suites**: 12 comprehensive test suites
- **Test Files**: Organized into 8 focused modules + aggregator
- **Port Conflicts**: Eliminated through systematic port migration
