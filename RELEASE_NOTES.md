  - All new exports and feature modules properly bundled

### üéØ Testing & Validation
- **3-Tier Testing Strategy**: All functionality validated across:
  - ‚úÖ Sandbox environment (manual browser testing)  
  - ‚úÖ CLI testing (automated unit tests)
  - ‚úÖ React browser testing (integration validation)

### üìä Metrics
- **100% Backward Compatibility**: All existing APIs continue to work
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: Factory function maintains same interface
- **Enhanced Modularity**: 5 feature domains with dedicated utilities
